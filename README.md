Startup Intel Agent
Startup Intel Agent is a Streamlit-based AI research assistant that gathers and summarizes startup intelligence from the web. It integrates real-time search data with large language model reasoning to provide concise insights about emerging companies. The agent leverages Google Gemini via LangChain and pulls data from Google Search (via SerpAPI), ProductHunt, and Crunchbase.

Features
This project includes the following functionality:

Real-time search and data extraction for startup-related queries

Summarization of key insights using Google Gemini (via LangChain)

Modular tools for ProductHunt, Crunchbase, and SerpAPI

Lightweight and responsive frontend built with Streamlit

Environment-variable based API key configuration

Extensible framework for adding more tools or LLM agents

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/startup-intel-agent.git
cd startup-intel-agent
Create and activate a virtual environment
bash
Copy
Edit
conda create -n ai-assistant python=3.11
conda activate ai-assistant
Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure your API keys
Create a .env file in the root directory and add:

ini
Copy
Edit
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_api_key
Optionally, include ProductHunt and Crunchbase API keys if you're using those modules.

Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
This will open the web interface in your browser. You can input a startup name or industry term and receive an aggregated, summarized report.

Deployment Instructions
Push the code to your GitHub repository

Sign in to Streamlit Cloud

Deploy a new app using frontend/streamlit_app.py as the main file

In the app settings, add the required secrets (GEMINI_API_KEY, SERPAPI_API_KEY, etc.)

Launch the app on the web

Notes on Gemini API Access
This application uses Google Gemini through LangChain's integration. Ensure your API key is active and has access to the necessary model endpoints.

If you encounter LLM-related errors or empty responses:

Verify your GEMINI_API_KEY is correct and active

Check your usage quota on Google Cloud

Ensure you're using a supported region or endpoint

Technical Scope and Developer Notes
This project demonstrates:

LangChain agent construction and tool orchestration

LLM-based summarization using Gemini

External API integrations with error handling

A modular toolchain for future extension

Streamlit interface design for rapid prototyping

Secure environment management and deployment practices
